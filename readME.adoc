.Description of the project
We will use the passive buzzer and a potentiometer to make the passive buzzer
buzz at different potentiometer levels. We set the potentiometer to output point slop
value of y = (9940/1023)(x) + 60 to give us a tone that has a delayMicroseconds(60)
at far left and delayMicrosconds(10000) at far right. To see how I put this into
the code, check out the file PassiveBuzzer.ino. So, when we turn the potentiometer
we will hear different tones throughout the full scale.

.Items Needed
* One 10k Ohm potentiometer
* One Passive Buzzer
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Seven jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the passive buzzer postive leg at column 15 and the
negative leg to column 18. I installed the left leg of the 10k ohm potentiometer 
in column 30, with the middle leg into column 32, and the right leg into column
34. Now it is time to run the jumper wires. I ran the GND from the Arduino R3 GND
to the GND rail. Jumper wire from pin 8 on the Arduino to column 15. Jumper wire
5V on the Arduino to positive rail on breadboard. Jumper wire from pin A0 on the
Arduino to column 32. I ran jumper wire from GND on rail to column 18. Jumper wire 
from positive rail to column 30. Then the last jumper wire from GND rail to column
34. This should close the circuit.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "PassiveBuzzer.ino".

.What To Expect
Once the code is done and you upload to the Arduino, you are ready to turn the 
potentiometer to see if your passive buzzers buzzes at you. We coded Serial.println
to display the potentiometer's value so you can see the buzzer changes
frequencies as you turn the potentiometer.
Not much other then hearing the buzzing change pitch to this circuit, but still 
good practice to work on wiring and coding. Good refresher for math to calculate the 
Point Slop to make a Slop Line to have the Arduino buzz the pasive buzzer to the scale.
